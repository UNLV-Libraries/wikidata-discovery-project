Note: All SPARQL files in this directory are the most recent versions of all source queries used in the application.
They are fully coded to provide results in the UNLV scope. They do not have scope filter tags inserted into them. Filter
tags are added manually through the admin interface for the application: in the discover_filter table for tag definitions,
and the wd_query table, where the tags are inserted in place of the value for wdt:P5008.
