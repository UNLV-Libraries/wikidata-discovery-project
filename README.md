# Wikidata Discovery Tool Development

## Introduction
This project is an effort to develop an end-user application for searching and retrieving Wikidata information that describes the contents of UNLV's Special Collections and Archives.

The application interacts with Wikidata's [SPARQL query service](https://query.wikidata.org/) and provides users with point-and-click tools to search and filter information. No SPARQL or other coding knowledge will be required to retrieve data linked across the Wikidata knowledge graph.

* [Cory Lampert](https://guides.library.unlv.edu/prf.php?account_id=53953): Project sponsor and linked data advisor.
* [Andre Hulet](https://github.com/aehulet): Application developer.
